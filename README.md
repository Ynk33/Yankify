Welcome to Yankify, my custom front framework designed with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

After cloning the repo, be sure to change its origin to the proper repo you'd like to use.

Then, install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

And finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
